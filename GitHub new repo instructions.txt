steps to 
1. create git repo 
2. open https://github.com/new
3. fill in repo name
4. in Ubuntu, change directory to local folder to be hosted in github
5. git init at command line (you will see a .git file in the folder)
6. tell local github the upstream URI location: git remote add origin https://github.com/ggbong734/udacity-dend-project1.git
7. To stage items use: git add <file_name> or git add . to recursively add all files
8. git status to check what items are staged
9. make initial commit using: git commit -m "first commit message"
10. Push commited changes to upstream repo in github: git push origin master 

11. Extra: To change file name: git mv old_file_name new_file_name
12. To check upstream repo locations: git remote -v


Troubleshooting:
How to sync remote and local branches if both are modified (git push gives error):
`hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes`

Rebase the local directory using: git pull --rebase origin master
This will rewind changes made in local to the same baseline as the remote repo, then apply the remote changes and then apply local changes so no changes are lost.
